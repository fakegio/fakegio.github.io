          <h2>Introducing The Problem</h2>
          <p>
            I've watched horror movies ever since I was a kid. Over the years,
            it's become increasingly challenging to discover ones I haven't
            already seen. As my list of viewed mainstream movies expands, I find
            myself delving deeper into niche movies. Although, I don't want to
            spend half of a movie just to figure out if I'll enjoy it or not.
            The main question I have is can I utilize clustering to identify
            horror movies I haven't watched and might enjoy?
          </p>
          <h2>What Is Clustering?</h2>
          <p>
            Clustering is a machine learning technique that involves grouping
            data points. Data points in the same group have similar properties,
            while data in different groups have dissimilar properties. In this
            project, I'm going to use a specific type of clustering called
            K-Means clustering. For K-Means Clustering, we must first decide how
            many clusters we want to have. We can decide on this by using what's
            called the elbow method. The elbow method calculates and graphs the
            sum of the square distance between points in a cluster and the
            center of the cluster. It does this for a range of clusters, usually
            1-10, and the number of clusters is decided on which K in the graph
            represents an "elbow". After deciding on how many clusters we want
            to have in our model, we randomly initialize the centroids of each
            cluster. Each data point is categorized by calculating it's distance
            between each centroid and classifying the point to be in the group
            whose center is closest. After all data points are clustered, the
            center of each cluster is recalculated by taking the mean of its
            data points. This process is repeated until the clusters stop
            changing.

          <h2>Introducing The Data</h2>
          <p>
            I found my dataset on

            ></a
            >Kaggle. The dataset includes horror movies dating back from the
            1950s. The data includes 32,540 rows and 20 columns. The columns
            include:
            <ul>
                <li>id</li>
                <li>original title</li>
                <li>title</li>
                <li>original language</li>
                <li>movie description</li>
                <li>movie tagline</li>
                <li>release date</li>
                <li>a URL path to the poster</li>
                <li>popularity (as of September 2023)</li>
                <li>vote count (number of ratings)</li>

                <li>runtime in minutes</li>
                <li>status (e.g., released)</li>
                <li>genre</li>
                <li>collection id</li>
