        <h2>Introducing The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          There's a belief that states college students can only choose two out
          of the following three: a social life, good grades, and adequate
          sleep. This can be accredited to numerous factors such as a rigorous
          course load, student employment, extracurriculars, bad time
          management, etc. In this project, I will be exploring if students
          attending Duke University suffer from this dilemma or if they manage
          to find a balance between the three. Some questions I am planning to
          answer are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How does a social life affect academic performance?</li>
          <li>How does sleep affect academic performance?</li>
          <li>
            Can Duke students have all 3 of the following: A social life, good
            grades, and an adequate amount of sleep.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Introducing The Data</h2>
        <img src="dist/img/df_head_before.PNG" alt="head of dataset before" />
        <p>
          I found the dataset on
          <a
            href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/duke-students-gpa"
            >Kaggle</a
          >
          but the original can be found on
          <a href="https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=gpa"
            >OpenIntro</a
          >. The data set includes information from a survey conducted at Duke.
          This survey asked 55 students their GPA, the number of hours they
          study per week, how many hours they sleep per night, how often they go
          out per week, and their gender.
        </p>
        <h2>Pre-Processing</h2>
        <img src="dist/img/isNull.PNG" alt="sum of null values" />
        <p>
          Upon first inspection, I started off by checking the data for any null
          values, luckily there were none.
        </p>
        <img src="dist/img/drop_gender.PNG" alt="drop gender column" />
        <p>
          I proceeded to drop the gender column as it won't have any effect on
          the questions I'm hoping to answer.
        </p>
        <img src="dist/img/rename.PNG" alt="renamed columns" />
        <p>
          Next, I decided to change each column name to something a bit more
          descriptive.
        </p>
        <img
          src="dist/img/math_floor.PNG"
          alt="rounded down nights per week values"
        />
        <p>
          Then, I rounded the nights out per week values down because it doesn't
          make sense to go out half a night per week, to me at least.
        </p>
        <img src="dist/img/df_head.PNG" alt="df head after" />
        <p>
          Due to the small sample size of the dataset and no null values, there
          wasn't much pre-processing to do.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
        <img
          src="dist/img/distribution_studying.png"
          alt="distribution of GPA vs weekly studying hours"
        />
        <p>
          First, I wanted to see the distribution between GPA and weekly study
          hours. This bar plot shows the average GPA over the distribution of
          hours of studying per week. The highest average GPA is associated with
          14 hours of studying per week, but the larger error bar for this
          specific value indicates that there is more variability compared to
          the rest of the hourly values.
        </p>
        <img
          src="dist/img/heatmap_p1_features.png"
          alt="student behaviors and academic performance"
        />
        <p>
          This heatmap illustrates the correlations between the features. A
          value closer to 1 indicates a stronger positive linear correlation
          between the two features, while a value closer to -1 indicates a
          stronger negative linear correlation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was surprising to observe the strongest positive correlation
          between two features: sleep per night and nights out per week. One
          might expect that going out more frequently would result in less
          sleep, but this correlation suggests the opposite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observing the correlation between hours of study per week and GPA was
          also intriguing. The data suggests a very weak positive correlation of
          0.04 between the two, making it the joint weakest correlation among
          the group.
        </p>
        <h3>Social Habits</h3>
        <img
          src="dist/img/distribution_nights.png"
          alt="distribution of students weekly nights out"
        />
        <p>
          Beginning the exploration of students' weekly nights out, it's evident
          that the majority engage in some level of social activity. Out of the
          55 students surveyed, only two abstain from going out entirely. The
          most common frequency is once a week, with approximately 19 students
          following this pattern. Interestingly, 34 students go out at least
          twice a week, showing that this data set as a whole is quite social.
        </p>
        <p>Now, let's see how these social habits affect GPA, if at all.</p>
        <img
          src="dist/img/nights_vs_gpa.png"
          alt="gpa changes with nights out"
        />
        <p>
          This line plot illustrates the relationship between nights out per
          week and GPA. Surprisingly, It shows that as the number of nights out
          per week increases, GPA generally increases as well. However, an
          interesting observation is a slight decrease in GPA when transitioning
          from 1 to 2 nights per week. Besides that, Duke students generally
          tend to have a higher GPA as they go out more frequently during the
          week.
        </p>
        <h3>Sleep Habits</h3>
        <p>
          According to the
          <a
            href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep/how-much-sleep#:~:text=Experts%20recommend%20that%20adults%20sleep,or%20more%20hours%20a%20night."
            >National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</a
          >, adults should be getting at least 7 hours of sleep at night.
        </p>
        <img
          src="dist/img/sleep_distribution.png"
          alt="distribution of student sleep hours"
        />
        <p>
          Out of the 55 surveyed students, 36 reported getting the recommended
          minimum 7 hours of sleep, while 19 students indicated that they don't
          get enough sleep.
        </p>
        <img
          src="dist/img/sleep_vs_gpa.png"
          alt="relationship between hours of sleep and gpa"
        />
        <p>
          With the exception of one student, all students were able to maintain
          a GPA above or equal to 3.0, regardless of the amount of sleep they
          got per night. The regression line shows a slight positive trend
          suggesting the more sleep per night, the higher their GPA. The
          confidence interval narrows around 7 hours of sleep, indicating higher
          certainty in this range compared to the rest of the regression line.
        </p>
        <h3>The Dilemma Visualization</h3>
        <img
          src="dist/img/dilemma_visual.png"
          alt="visualizing gpa, social life, and sleep habits"
        />
        <p>
          The above bubble chart shows nightly hours of sleep on the x-axis, GPA
          on the y-axis, and the color of the bubbles represent weekly nights
          out. A cluster of students gets 7 hours of sleep, with GPAs ranging
          from 3.25 to 4.0. Most of these students go out 1-2 nights per week.
          Another intriguing cluster is the one with 8 hours of sleep and a GPA
          ranging from 3.75 to 4.0. This small cluster contains a wider range of
          weekly nights out from 1-4 nights.
        </p>
        <h2>Storytelling</h2>
        <p>
          In summary, I wanted to explore how the sleep, social life, and GPA
          habits affect one another. I was able to find trends that weren't too
          surprising, such as a positive regression between sleep and GPA, and
          trends that were pretty surprising, such as a consistent increase in
          GPA as students have more weekly nights out. I was personally
          surprised to see that the majority of students actually get the
          minimum recommended amount of sleep. As a college student surrounded
          by other students, it's hard to find people who get at least 7 hours
          of sleep consistently. All in all, it seems that this population at
          Duke can maintain a balance between grades, sleep, and a social life.
        </p>
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>
          The positive trend shown in the relationship between social life and
          GPA may cause some harm, as going out every night does not guarantee a
          higher GPA. With only 55 students, this small sample may contain
          inaccuracies. This could be mitigated by including additional data,
          such as whether students work and their weekly working hours, as well
          as distinguishing between undergraduate and graduate students. Also,
          Duke is a prestigous university that selects top candidates, so their
          students are generally more responsible and disciplined. Exploring
          these habits may vary by university, especially ones with a strong
          party culture.
