        <h2>Introducing The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          According to the
          <a
            href="https://www.statista.com/topics/789/wages-and-salary/#topicOverview"
            >Statista Research Department</a
          >, the average annual wage in 2021 was estimated to be $74,738.
          However, a study published by
          <a href="https://jenzabar.com/2021-education-and-employment-survey"
            >Jenzabar</a
          >
          in the same year, found that nearly half of American adults feel
          they're underpaid. To address this concern, I believe that promoting
          salary transparency can play a pivotal role in fighting underpayment.
          So, I aim to predict salaries based on factors like age, education,
          and experience. I also want to answer how much of an impact does
          education have on salary? Does education contribute more to salary
          than experience? By revealing how salaries are determined, we can help
          address the problem of underpayment and make the job market fairer for
          everyone.
        </p>
        <h2>Introducing The Data</h2>
        <img src="dist/img/project_3/introduce_data.PNG" alt="introduce data" />
        <p>
          For this project, I'm going to be using a salary dataset found on
          <a
            href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data/data"
            >Kaggle</a
          >. This dataset includes 6,704 rows and 6 columns. The columns consist
          of age, years of experience, job title, education level, and salary.
        </p>
        <h2>What Is Regression?</h2>
        <p>
          Regression is a statistical method used to model a target value based
          on independent predictors. The two types of regression we've talked
          about are linear regression and logistic regression. Linear regression
          is used to find the relationship between independent and dependent
          variables. Upon doing this, the regression model is then used to
          predict continuous values. Logistic regression is mainly used for
          classification purposes. Logistic regression usually has a finite
          number of outcomes/outputs, such as "spam" or "not spam."
        </p>
        <p>
          In this project, I'm going to be utilizing linear regression. So, how
          does it work? First, we use the "least squares" method to fit a line
          to the data. The least squares method sums up the squared value of the
          individual residuals of a given line. This sum is sometimes called the
          sum of squared residuals. The line of best fit is found by looking for
          the slope and intercept of the line that best minimizes the sum of
          squared residuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finding the line of best fit, we can use R^2, also known as the
          coefficient of determination, to tell us how much of our target can be
          explained by our features. In other words, how "good" is our line of
          best-fit.
        </p>
        <img src="dist/img/project_3/r_squared.jpg" alt="R squared formula" />
        <h1>Experiment 1</h1>
        <br />
        <h2>Data Understanding</h2>
        <img src="dist/img/project_3/describe_data.PNG" alt="describe data" />
        <p>
          Before diving in, I decided to look at the mean and standard deviation
          for the numerical variables to get a better understanding of the data.
        </p>
        <img src="dist/img/project_3/salary_age.png" alt="Salary by age" />
        <p>
          Then, I plotted the relationship between age and salary. As you can
          see, there is a strong positive correlation suggesting that as age
          increases, salary tends to increase as well.
        </p>
        <img
          src="dist/img/project_3/salary_experience.png"
          alt="Salary by experience"
        />
        <p>
          Next, I examined the relationship between years of experience and
          salary, which revealed a strong resemblance to the previous graph.
          This trend implies that individuals with more years of experience tend
          to have a higher salary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The consistent, upward trajectory depicted in the graphs underline the
          influence that both age and years of experience have over an
          individual's salary.
        </p>
        <img
          src="dist/img/project_3/salary_by_gender.png"
          alt="Salary by gender"
        />
        <p>
          Finally, I wanted to see how gender affects salary. This bar chart
          illustrates a comparison of average salaries across different gender
          categories. The bar for males depicts an average salary of around
          120,000 USD, while the female category shows an average salary of
          around 110,000 USD. Additionally, the 'Other' category indicates an
          average salary floating around 125,000 USD. This visual representation
          highlights the disparities in average salaries among the different
          gender groups, emphasizing potential variations in earnings based on
          gender.
        </p>
        <p>
          These visualizations made a strong argument to use age, years of
          experience, and gender in our regression model to predict salary.
        </p>
        <h2>Pre-Processing</h2>
        <img src="dist/img/project_3/null_table_1.PNG" alt="null table" />
        <p>Searching for nulls. We can drop the first two rows immediately.</p>
        <img src="dist/img/project_3/null_table_2.PNG" alt="null table" />
        <p>
          Dropping the 3rd row due to insufficient amount of information to fill
          in the null values.
        </p>
        <img src="dist/img/project_3/null_table_3.PNG" alt="null table" />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="dist/img/project_3/developer_table.PNG"
          alt="developer table"
        />
        <p>
          I had planned to count the education levels for the 'Developer' job
          title and fill in the null value, but since this row is the only one
          with this job title, I'll drop it.
        </p>
        <img src="dist/img/project_3/null_table_4.PNG" alt="null table" />
        <p>
          Now, for each of these rows, I'm going to take the average salary
          based on their education level, job title, and years of experience to
          fill in the null value.
        </p>
        <img

        />
        <p>
          Now, because regression models require numerical features, the "Job
          Title" column would have to undergo some encoding to be used.
          Although, considering the numerous job titles, this might introduce
          unnecessary complexity to the model. Therefore, I decided to drop the
          job title column altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before: ["Bachelor's", "Master's", 'PhD', "Bachelor's Degree",
          "Master's Degree", 'High School', 'phD']
        </p>
        <p>After: ["Bachelor's", "Master's", 'PhD', 'High School']</p>
        <p>
          I realized the education levels were redundant, so I categorized them
          into: 'High School', 'Bachelors', 'Masters', and 'PhD' for the sake of
          consistency.
        </p>
        <img
          src="dist/img/project_3/head_after_encoding.PNG"
          alt="data after encoding"
        />
        <p>
          I proceeded to one-hot encode the non-numerical columns to use in our
          model.
        </p>
        <h2>Modeling</h2>
        <p>
          Before we build our model, we must standardize our numerical features.
        </p>
        <img
          src="dist/img/project_3/standardization.PNG"
          alt="standardization"
        />
        <p>
          Now, we can separate our features from the target and fit the model.
        </p>
        <img
          src="dist/img/project_3/separate_features.PNG"
          alt="separate features"
        />
        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Mean Absolute Error: 22891.561958207098</li>
          <li>Root Mean Square Error: 29645.72737355227</li>
          <li>Coefficient of Determination: 0.6460415017773518</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For the model evaluation, I used the mean absolute error and root mean
          squared error metrics. I chose these two metrics because they are in
          the units of our target variable, making them easier to interpret. For
          both metrics, the closer it is to zero, the less errors are in our
          model. The mean absolute error is 22,891 meaning our salary prediction
          is about 22,891 USD off from the actual value. The root mean squared
          error says our salary prediction is 29,645 USD off from the actual
          salary.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also included the coefficient of determination show how the model
          explains the variance in the dependent variables based on the
          independent variable. The score suggests the model accounts for about
          64.6% of the variability in the data, leaving approximately 35.4%
          unexplained by the model.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the next two experiments, I'm going to drop a column, one at a
          time, to view how much of an impact they have on our results.
        </p>
        <h1>Experiment 2</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          For this experiment, I am going to drop the years of experience column
          and compare the results from the previous experiment.
        </p>
        <img
          src="dist/img/project_3/experiment_2_head.PNG"
          alt="experiment 2 head"
        />
        <ul>
          <li>Mean Absolute Error: 24441.00019640226</li>
          <li>Root Mean Square Error: 31998.210632092967</li>
          <li>Coefficient of Determination: 0.633152075132096</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Using the metrics, this model's results looks similar to the first
          experiment's results. We can conclude that years of experience doesn't
          have much of an impact on this model.
        </p>
        <h1>Experiment 3</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          For this experiment, I'm dropping the education columns and comparing
          the results from the previous experiments.
        </p>
        <img
          src="dist/img/project_3/experiment_3.PNG"
          alt="experiment 3 head"
        />
        <ul>
          <li>Mean Absolute Error: 25151.773666518955</li>
          <li>Root Mean Square Error: 32248.327308551154</li>
          <li>Coefficient of Determination: 0.5811654410322951</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These metrics differ significantly from the previous two evaluations.
          Compared to the first experiment, both the mean absolute error and
          root mean squared error have increased by approximately 3,000.
          Moreover, the coefficient of determination demonstrates a substantial
          impact, dropping by 8%, from 64% to 58%. This experiment highlights
          the significant role of the 'education' feature in predicting salary,
          demonstrating its greater impact compared to experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>
          By demonstrating the significant impact of education on salary
          prediction, this project has the potential to inspire individuals who
          are undecided about furthering their education. The correlation
          between education level and salary prediction can serve as an
          incentive for those contemplating returning to school. Highlighting
          the higher salary associated with higher education might encourage
          individuals to invest in their education.
        </p>
        <p>
          While showcasing the importance of education in salary prediction,
          it's essential to acknowledge that some individuals may face financial
          constraints that hinder their ability to pursue higher education.
          Individuals who aspire to pursue education but lack the financial
          means could become discouraged, potentially leading to a sense of
          decreased motivation to pursue professional growth
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          I saw first-hand how much weight some features have over others. In my
          case, education had the most influence. During the third experiment, I
          initially removed the 'age' column and conducted a comparison of the
          results. However, due to the similarity with the outcomes of the first
          two experiments, I replaced it with the 'education' column. I also
          learned how important it is to use multiple metrics because they vary
          and have their own advantages/disadvantages.
        </p>
